The task involves creating an application that identifies pairs of employees within a given set of projects. The goal is to determine the pair of employees who have worked together on common projects for the longest period of time. The application needs to consider the start and end dates of each employee's involvement in the projects to calculate the total duration of their collaboration. Additionally, the application should provide information about the specific projects during which the identified pairs worked together and the corresponding time duration for each of those projects. Overall, the application aims to find and present insights into the longest collaborative work between pairs of employees on shared projects.
